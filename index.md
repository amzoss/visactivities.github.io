This workshop focuses on _data-visualization activities_, especiallymethods and challenges for teaching and engaging with data visual-ization concepts, knowledge, and practices. For example,sketchingaids designers to consider alternative ideas; manipulatingtokenshelp students conceptualize quantities for data visualization; userinterviews anddiscussionshelp developers understand requirements.Workshops, classes, or collaborations with domain experts, ofteninclude hands-on data visualization activities that involve analog ordigital tools and materials and more or less well defined protocols.Recent years have seen the emergence of such data visualizationactivities in different contexts, including education, visualizationdesign, activism, self-reflection, and interdisciplinary collaboration.However,  the  broad  range  of  contexts  and  target  audiences  thatData-Vis activities have been applied to makes it difficult to collectand identify commonalities and build knowledge in a systematicway.  Thus, the goals of this workshop arei)start building an un-derstanding and to synthesize protocols and materials used to leaddata vis activities,ii)to bring together researchers, practitioners, andeducators from within and outside of the visualization community,iii)brainstorm, design, experience, and try novel activities, and toiv)discuss issues around goals, methods, audiences, materials, andevaluation for teaching data visualization
